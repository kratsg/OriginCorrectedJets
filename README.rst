Origin-Corrected Topoclusters
=============================

Question: what are the performance differences between

* "normal", topocluster jets (Anti-Kt R=1.0 LC Topo Jets)
* p-flow jets
* origin-corrected jets

as compared to the truth jets? How does substructure change? How does the behavior of substructure top-tagging perform across the board?

This is for `HFSF2015 <https://github.com/US-ATLAS-HFSF/HFSF2015>`_.

Datasets
--------

We need datasets that have the pflow objects -- see `this bigpanda page (12/15/2015) <http://bigpanda.cern.ch/tasks/?workinggroup=perf-jets>`_ for a list of datasets at the time of writing. We reiterate the list below::
