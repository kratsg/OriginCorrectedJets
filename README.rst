Origin-Corrected Topoclusters
=============================

Question: what are the performance differences between

    * "normal", topocluster jets (Anti-Kt R=1.0 LC Topo Jets)
    * p-flow jets
    * origin-corrected jets

as compared to the truth jets? How does substructure change? How does the behavior of substructure top-tagging perform across the board?

This is for `HFSF2015 <https://github.com/US-ATLAS-HFSF/HFSF2015>`_.
